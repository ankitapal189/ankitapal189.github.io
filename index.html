        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Ankita Pal!</h1>
				<p>
					Enthusiastic and self-driven MS in Data Science student at the University of Washington. Developed solid experience in the field of data analytics and data science through my undergraduate program and work experience, and pursuing the graduate program in my area of interest further enables me to sharpen my data science skills with the help and guidance of the esteemed faculty and alumni. Earlier, I worked in Axtria, a data pharmaceutical analytics company, for 2 years. Worked on technologies like AWS Redshift and Azure data factory to create robust data pipelines that tracked, transformed and stored data in databases. Developed automated codes to generate monthly extracts from these databases resulting in reduced required man-hours. Completed my Bachelors of Technology from Delhi Technological University in the field of Mathematics and Computing Engineering. Took up several projects that covered the areas of Data Collection, Regression Modelling, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis.
I am fluent in both R and Python and have a good grasp of both languages. Dedicated professional and a quick learner, who is willing to put extra hours to get a difficult task at hand done. I am looking for an intern opportunity in Summer 2020. If my profile matches your requirements please feel free to contact me.
